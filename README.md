# allow users to decide if they want to use the restraint criteria for daily calories or nutritional values
# - need list of nutritional values we want to include (i think iron would be good - for vegetarians/vegans), fat, and sodium to at least start with
# would need to have serving sizes, so that we can tell people how much to buy and we know how many calories/nutrients per serving
# would need to have input for how many days they want between shopping trips, with a max of 7 days (cause fresh foods don't stay fresh that long
# version 2.0 we could have users add foods that we don't already have
# verison 2.0 we could suggest things based on stuff they like (ML or AI exercise)
